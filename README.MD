# FastAPI PDF Q&A Service

This project provides a lightweight FastAPI-based service that allows users to:

1. **Upload a PDF or Image** and receive a `session_id`.
2. **Ask questions** about the uploaded content using the `session_id`.

| **Uvicorn**          | ASGI server for serving the FastAPI app                                 |
| **python-multipart** | Enables file uploads in FastAPI                                         |
| **LangChain**        | Manages prompt orchestration, document retrieval, and LLM integration   |
| **OpenAI**           | Used for LLM-based answers (e.g., GPT-3.5 / GPT-4)                      |
| **ChromaDB**         | Local vector database for document chunk storage and similarity search  |
| **PyMuPDF (fitz)**   | PDF text extraction                                                     |
| **pytesseract**      | OCR engine to extract text from images                                  |
| **Pillow (PIL)**     | Image manipulation and format handling                                  |
| **tiktoken**         | Token counting and chunking for LLM context management                  |
| **python-dotenv**    | Manages secret keys and config from `.env` files                        |
| **git-filter-repo**  | Used to clean sensitive data (e.g., API keys) from Git history          |

## Important: Set Tesseract Path

If you're using Windows and `pytesseract`, make sure to set the correct path to the Tesseract executable:

```python
import fitz
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
import io

# Update this path to your local Tesseract installation
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Users\RakeshRanjan\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
```
